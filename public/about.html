  Hi! My name is Mehmet Salman. I actually haven't completed law school yet, but I have decided to 
  make my dream of becoming a developer come true. I started learning to become a developer when it 
  wasn't too late.</p>
  
<p>I am from Turkey and I don't have many hobbies. I enjoy watching movies, especially those directed
   by Scorsese and Tarantino. Most of the time, before I play CS:GO and when I have school, I stay at
    home. However, during the semester, I go somewhere and find a job because life is expensive here.</p>
  
<p>Currently, I have to work, and it may be my last days on my computer because my school is done and
   I need to earn money to survive. But I will try my best because I can't stay here anyway. I 
   understand that everyone wants to see more positive content, but there seems to be no way because 
   nobody will notice their own page.</p>
  
<p>My main goal is to go abroad from here because I want to build a better life. Here, we work 
  endlessly without breaks, and one day life comes to an end. So, I am trying to learn new things here
   to find a job abroad in the future, although I probably won't be able to. That's all.</p>
